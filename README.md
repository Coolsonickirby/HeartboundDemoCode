# Heartbound (Demo) Code Dump

This is a repository containing a dump of all the code contained in the Demo Version of Heartbound that's currently avaliable on Steam for free. You can go ahead and look through the code written by a "developer" who's worked for 7 years in Blizzard, the "Bob Ross of Programming", and a "master" hacker.

If you want to see the code in the full version of the game, you'll need to buy the full game on Steam and then extract the code resources from the `data.win` file with [Undertale Mod Tool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/releases/tag/0.8.2.0). You can watch a [mini tutorial here](https://youtu.be/iYgsjl36wmQ) (just replace the Demo version with the Full version.)

I personally wouldn't recommend buying the full game (a sentiment shared with Jason (PirateSoftware) himself) and just enjoy looking through the code dump here.
